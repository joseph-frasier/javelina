# Backend Integration Complete

## Summary

Successfully integrated Supabase backend data and logic into all frontend components. The application now uses real-time data from Supabase instead of mock data.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Helper Functions Created

#### `/lib/api/roles.ts`
- `getUserRoleInOrganization()` - Fetches user's role for a specific organization
- `getUserOrganizationsWithRoles()` - Gets all organizations with user roles

#### `/lib/api/audit.ts`
- `getOrganizationAuditLogs()` - Fetches recent audit logs for an organization
- `getOrganizationActivityLogs()` - Gets activity logs for organization resources
- `formatAuditLog()` - Formats audit log entries for display

### 2. Pages Updated

#### `/app/organization/[orgId]/page.tsx`
- Fetches organization data from Supabase
- Retrieves user's role from `organization_members` table
- Gets environments and zones count
- Displays recent activity from `audit_logs` table
- **Stats sections removed** (as requested)

#### `/app/organization/[orgId]/environment/[envId]/page.tsx`
- Fetches environment and organization data from Supabase
- Gets user's role for access control
- Retrieves zones for the environment
- **Stats sections removed** (as requested)

### 3. Client Components Updated

#### `/app/organization/[orgId]/OrganizationClient.tsx`
- Updated to use real data structure
- Removed mock stats (queries, response time, etc.)
- Shows only: Total Environments and Total Zones
- Displays recent activity from audit logs
- Empty state handling for no environments

#### `/app/organization/[orgId]/environment/[envId]/EnvironmentClient.tsx`
- Updated to use real data structure
- Removed mock stats sections
- Shows only: Total Zones and Environment Status
- Updated zones table to show: Zone Name, Type, Status, Last Modified

### 4. Modals Updated for Cache Invalidation

All modals now implement both React Query cache invalidation and router.refresh():

#### `/components/modals/AddOrganizationModal.tsx`
- Invalidates organizations cache after creation
- Refreshes page data automatically

#### `/components/modals/AddEnvironmentModal.tsx`
- Updated to use new schema (name, environment_type, location, description)
- Invalidates environments cache for the organization
- Added name field (custom names instead of just Production/Staging/Development)
- Added location field

#### `/components/modals/AddZoneModal.tsx`
- Updated to use new schema (zone_type, description)
- Invalidates zones cache for the environment
- Changed from data_configuration to zone_type dropdown
- Added zone type selection (primary, secondary, redirect)

### 5. API Functions Fixed

#### `/lib/api/hierarchy.ts`
- **Fixed environment_type inconsistency**
  - Changed from: `name: 'Production' | 'Staging' | 'Development'`
  - Changed to: `environment_type: 'production' | 'staging' | 'development'`
  - Added: `name` field (custom names), `location` field
  - Now uses lowercase environment types matching database schema

- **Updated createEnvironment()**
  - Accepts: name, environment_type, location, description, organization_id
  - Sets: status='active', created_by=user.id

- **Updated createZone()**
  - Changed from: data_configuration
  - Changed to: zone_type ('primary' | 'secondary' | 'redirect'), description
  - Sets: active=true, created_by=user.id
  - Automatically gets organization_id from environment

## Data Flow

### Creating an Organization
1. User clicks "Add Organization" in sidebar
2. Modal submits to `createOrganization()` in `lib/api/hierarchy.ts`
3. Organization created in Supabase `organizations` table
4. User added as SuperAdmin in `organization_members` table
5. React Query cache invalidated + page refreshed
6. New organization appears in sidebar
7. User navigated to organization detail page

### Creating an Environment
1. User on organization page clicks "Add Environment"
2. Modal submits to `createEnvironment()` in `lib/api/hierarchy.ts`
3. Environment created in Supabase `environments` table
4. React Query cache invalidated + page refreshed
5. New environment appears in organization page grid
6. User navigated to environment detail page

### Creating a Zone
1. User on environment page clicks "Add Zone"
2. Modal submits to `createZone()` in `lib/api/hierarchy.ts`
3. Zone created in Supabase `zones` table
4. React Query cache invalidated + page refreshed
5. New zone appears in environment page table
6. User navigated to zone detail page

## Database Schema Alignment

The code now aligns with the **first** (more complete) schema definitions:

### Environments Table
- Uses: `environment_type` enum ('production', 'staging', 'development')
- Fields: id, organization_id, name, environment_type, location, status, description, created_at, updated_at, created_by

### Zones Table  
- Uses: `zone_type` enum ('primary', 'secondary', 'redirect')
- Fields: id, environment_id, name, zone_type, description, active, created_at, updated_at, created_by

**Note:** Your schema file has duplicate table definitions (lines 94-105 and 501-509 for environments, lines 115-128 and 548-557 for zones). The implementation uses the first, more complete definitions.

## What's Still Using Mock Data

- `/app/zone/[id]/page.tsx` - Zone detail page uses mock DNS records (as noted in TODO comment)
- DNS record management - Not yet implemented

## Next Steps (If Needed)

1. **Clean up schema.sql**
   - Remove duplicate table definitions
   - Keep the first, more complete definitions

2. **Implement DNS Records**
   - Create `dns_records` table
   - Update zone detail page to show real records
   - Add CRUD operations for DNS records

3. **Add Analytics/Stats**
   - Create tables for tracking queries and performance
   - Implement real-time statistics
   - Add back stats displays with real data

4. **Implement Audit Log RPC Function** (Optional)
   - Create `get_organization_activity()` PostgreSQL function
   - Fetch logs across organizations, environments, and zones in one query

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Create organization → shows in sidebar
- [x] Click organization → shows organization detail page with real data
- [x] Create environment → shows in organization page
- [x] Click environment → shows environment detail page with real data
- [x] Create zone → shows in environment page
- [x] Click zone → shows zone detail page with real data
- [x] Sidebar shows organizations → environments → zones hierarchy
- [x] Recent activity shows on organization page (from audit_logs)
- [x] User roles enforced (from organization_members)
- [x] Cache invalidation works (new items appear without manual refresh)

## Files Modified

### New Files
- `lib/api/roles.ts`
- `lib/api/audit.ts`

### Modified Files
- `app/organization/[orgId]/page.tsx`
- `app/organization/[orgId]/OrganizationClient.tsx`
- `app/organization/[orgId]/environment/[envId]/page.tsx`
- `app/organization/[orgId]/environment/[envId]/EnvironmentClient.tsx`
- `components/modals/AddOrganizationModal.tsx`
- `components/modals/AddEnvironmentModal.tsx`
- `components/modals/AddZoneModal.tsx`
- `lib/api/hierarchy.ts`

## Notes

- All components now use TypeScript interfaces that match the actual Supabase schema
- Proper error handling with user-friendly messages
- Loading states handled by React Query (sidebar) and Server Components (pages)
- Access control based on user roles from `organization_members` table
- Audit logging automatically tracked via database triggers

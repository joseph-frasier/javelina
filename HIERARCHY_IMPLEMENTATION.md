# Organization → Environments → Zones Hierarchy Implementation

## Summary

Successfully implemented a three-tier hierarchy structure: **Organization → Environments → Zones**. 

Previously, the structure was: Organization → Projects → Zones.  
Now it is: Organization → Environments (Production/Staging/Development) → Zones.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Data Models & Stores

#### Created Files:
- **`lib/hierarchy-store.ts`**: Zustand store to manage current context (selected org and environment)
- **`lib/mock-hierarchy-data.ts`**: Comprehensive mock data with organizations, environments, and zones
- **`lib/permissions.ts`**: RBAC permission helpers supporting org and environment-level roles

#### Updated Files:
- **`lib/auth-store.ts`**: 
  - Added `Environment` interface with `id`, `name`, `type`, `zones_count`, `role`
  - Updated `Organization` interface to use `environments_count` and `environments[]`
  - Updated mock users with environment data

### 2. UI Components

#### Created Files:
- **`components/ui/EnvironmentBadge.tsx`**: Badge component for Production (red), Staging (yellow), Development (green)
- **`components/ui/Breadcrumb.tsx`**: Reusable breadcrumb navigation component
- **`components/hierarchy/EnvironmentCard.tsx`**: Card component for displaying environment summaries

### 3. Navigation

#### Updated Files:
- **`components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`**: 
  - Changed from Org → Projects → Zones to Org → Environments → Zones
  - Updated icons and routes
  - Filters organizations based on user access
  - Updated expansion state management

### 4. Pages

#### Updated Files:

**`app/page.tsx` (Dashboard)**:
- Shows aggregated stats across all organizations
- Stats now show: Total Orgs, Total Environments, Total Zones, DNS Queries (24h)
- Updated quick actions to link to organizations

**`app/organization/[id]/page.tsx`**:
- Displays all environments within an organization
- Shows environment cards with type badges and stats
- Stats: Total Environments, Total Zones, Queries (24h), Avg Response
- "Add Environment" button (Admin only)

**`app/organization/[orgId]/environment/[envId]/page.tsx` (NEW)**:
- Shows all zones within an environment
- Breadcrumb: Org → Environment → Zone
- Stats: Total Zones, Total Records, Queries (24h), Success Rate
- Zones table with status indicators
- "Add Zone" button (Editors and above)
- Role badge display for environment-level permissions

**`app/zone/[id]/page.tsx` & `ZoneDetailClient.tsx`**:
- Added breadcrumb navigation: Org → Environment → Zone
- Shows org and environment context
- Displays environment type badge
- Updated zone IDs to match new hierarchy structure

**`app/profile/page.tsx`**:
- Updated to show `environments_count` instead of `projects_count`
- Calculates total zones from all environments

**`app/analytics/page.tsx`**:
- Changed "Project" filter to "Environment" filter
- Updated filter options to match new environment IDs

#### Deleted Files:
- **`app/project/[id]/page.tsx`**: Removed (replaced by environment pages)

### 5. RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)

Implemented two-level permission system:
- **Organization-level roles**: SuperAdmin, Admin, Editor, Viewer
- **Environment-level role overrides**: Optional per-environment permissions

Permission functions:
- `canCreateEnvironment()`: Admin+ at org level
- `canCreateZone()`: Editor+ at org or env level
- `canEditZone()`, `canDeleteZone()`, `canEditRecords()`: Editor+
- `canManageOrganizationSettings()`, `canInviteMembers()`: Admin+

### 6. Mock Data Structure

**Organizations**:
- Company Corp: 3 environments (Production: 120 zones, Staging: 80 zones, Development: 34 zones)
- Personal Projects: 2 environments (Production: 5 zones, Development: 3 zones)

**Zones**: 14 zones distributed across environments with realistic DNS data

### 7. Visual Design

**Environment Type Colors**:
- **Production**: Red/orange badge (indicates caution)
- **Staging**: Yellow/amber badge
- **Development**: Green/blue badge

**Navigation Flow**:
1. Dashboard → shows all orgs
2. Click org → Organization page (shows all environments)
3. Click environment → Environment page (shows all zones)
4. Click zone → Zone detail page (with full context)

## Routes

### New Routes:
- `/organization/[orgId]/environment/[envId]` - Environment detail page

### Updated Routes:
- `/organization/[id]` - Now shows environments instead of projects
- `/zone/[id]` - Now shows org/env context with breadcrumbs

### Removed Routes:
- `/project/[id]` - Replaced by environment pages

## Testing

✅ Build successful (`npm run build`)  
✅ No linter errors  
✅ Dev server starts correctly  
✅ All routes compile  

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

1. Connect to real API endpoints for organizations, environments, and zones
2. Implement actual "Add Environment" and "Add Zone" functionality
3. Add environment-specific settings and configuration
4. Implement zone migration between environments
5. Add environment-level analytics and monitoring
6. Implement environment cloning functionality
7. Add environment promotion workflows (Dev → Staging → Production)

## üêõ Fix Password Reset Error Handling

### Problem
Users were seeing an unhelpful "Load failed" error message when requesting password resets, making it difficult to understand what went wrong.

### Root Cause
Investigation of Supabase Auth Logs revealed the issue was a **security throttle** (HTTP 429):
```
"429: For security purposes, you can only request this after 42 seconds."
```

Supabase enforces a 60-second cooldown between password reset requests for the same email address to prevent abuse. However, our application was displaying a generic "Load failed" error instead of explaining this to users.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Enhanced `lib/auth-store.ts` - `resetPassword()` function
- ‚úÖ Added **detailed console logging** for debugging (logs email, reset URL, and errors)
- ‚úÖ Added **mock mode support** for testing without sending real emails
- ‚úÖ Implemented **specific error handling** for rate limits and email issues
- ‚úÖ Improved **user-facing error messages**:
  - Rate limit: "Too many requests. Please try again later."
  - Email issues: "Unable to send email. Please check your email address."
  - Generic: "Failed to send reset email. Please try again."

#### 2. Added Documentation
- `PASSWORD_RESET_DEBUG.md` - Comprehensive debugging guide
- `TEST_PASSWORD_RESET.md` - Step-by-step testing instructions
- `PASSWORD_RESET_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Complete fix summary with root cause analysis
- `CHECK_RATE_LIMITS.md` - Guide for checking and handling rate limit issues

#### 3. Updated `.gitignore`
- Added `.cursor/plans/` to prevent cursor plan files from being tracked

### Before vs After

**Before:**
```
User sees: "Load failed" ‚ùå
Console: (no helpful information)
```

**After:**
```
User sees: "Too many requests. Please try again later." ‚úÖ
Console: 
  - Sending password reset email to: user@example.com
  - Reset URL: http://localhost:3000/reset-password
  - Password reset error: For security purposes, you can only request this after 42 seconds
```

### User Experience Improvements
1. **Clear error messages** - Users now understand why the request failed
2. **Better debugging** - Console logs provide detailed information for troubleshooting
3. **Security maintained** - The 60-second throttle remains in place (as intended)
4. **Development support** - Mock mode allows testing without sending real emails

### Testing
The password reset flow has been enhanced with logging. To test:

1. Navigate to `/forgot-password`
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Enter an email and submit
4. Try submitting again within 60 seconds
5. Verify the error message is clear and helpful

Expected behavior:
- First request: Should succeed (or show specific error if configuration issue)
- Second request within 60 seconds: Shows "Too many requests. Please try again later."
- Console logs all attempts with detailed information

### Notes
- No changes to security behavior - the 60-second throttle is working as designed
- The fix improves error communication, not the underlying security feature
- Mock mode is available for development testing without hitting rate limits
